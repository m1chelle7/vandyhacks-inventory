# VandyHacks Inventory Manager

## The Problem Being Solved
**Operations:** "We have a lot of physical items to manage, such as t-shirts, stickers, and swag, but it's difficult to keep track of inventory and ensure that everything is delivered on time."

## The App and Its Value Proposition
Key features include: <br />

**Inventory Management:** The app enables efficient management of inventory items essential for Vandyhacks events. Currently, it displays inventory data and ongoing deliveries gathered from a database. <br />
**Streamlined Interface:** I designed the app with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Users can quickly find the information they need without navigating through cluttered menus or complex interfaces, enhancing productivity.
**Customization:** If the VandyHacks button is pressed, the user can switch from light to dark mode, and vice versa.
