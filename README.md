# VandyHacks Coding Assessment 2024 

## The Problem Being Solved
For this project, I chose to solve the Operations Team's problem.

**Operations:** "We have a lot of physical items to manage, such as t-shirts, stickers, and swag, but it's difficult to keep track of inventory and ensure that everything is delivered on time. If only there is an easy way to manage and track these items..."

## The App and Its Value Proposition
This application is for the VandyHacks Operations Team, who have an issue regarding inventory management. This application stores the quantity of merch delivered in a database and retrives the amount to display. 

## Demo

## Potential Additional Features
1. Finishing the functions (ie. adding to inventory, adding to deliveries, all the buttons)
2. The ability to add more types of physical items
3. A display with the club budget
4. More and better looking color schemes

## Run Commands
Server side: 'npm run dev', Client side: 'npm start'
