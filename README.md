# VandyHacks Coding Assessment 2024 

## The Problem Being Solved
For this project, I chose to solve the Operations Team's problem.

**Operations:** "We have a lot of physical items to manage, such as t-shirts, stickers, and swag, but it's difficult to keep track of inventory and ensure that everything is delivered on time. If only there is an easy way to manage and track these items..."

## The App and Its Value Proposition
Key features include: <br />

**Inventory Management:** The app enables efficient management of inventory items essential for Vandyhacks events. Currently, it displays inventory data and ongoing deliveries gathered from a database. <br />
**Streamlined Interface:** I designed the app with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Users can quickly find the information they need without navigating through cluttered menus or complex interfaces, enhancing productivity.
**Customization:** If the VandyHacks button is pressed, the user can switch from light to dark mode, and vice versa.

## Potential Additional Features
1. Finishing the functions (ie. adding to inventory, adding to deliveries, all the buttons)
2. The ability to add more types of physical items
3. A display with the club budget
4. More and better looking color schemes (+better accessibility)

## Run Commands
**Server side:** 'npm run dev' <br />
**Client side:** 'npm start'
